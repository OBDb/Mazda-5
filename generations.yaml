    description: "The first-generation Mazda5 (known as Premacy in Japan) introduced a compact minivan/MPV to the North American market that was smaller than traditional minivans but larger than typical compact cars. Built on a modified Mazda3 platform, it featured sliding rear doors for easy access and three rows of seating for up to six passengers. The exterior design was relatively conservative but functional, with high roofline and large glass areas for excellent visibility. In North America, it was powered by a 2.3L four-cylinder engine producing 157 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Other markets received various gasoline and diesel engine options. The interior featured flexible seating with second-row captain's chairs that could slide, recline, and fold, plus a third row that could accommodate smaller passengers or fold flat for cargo. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the Mazda5 offered impressive interior versatility with numerous storage compartments throughout the cabin. Handling was a highlight, with the vehicle earning praise for its car-like driving dynamics unusual in the minivan segment. Standard features included air conditioning, power windows and locks, while higher trims added amenities like automatic climate control, leather seating, and upgraded audio systems. A mild refresh in 2008 brought subtle styling updates and feature enhancements. The first-generation Mazda5 established itself as a unique offering in the North American market, combining minivan practicality with compact dimensions and engaging driving dynamics."

  - name: "Second Generation (CW)"

    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Mazda5 featured more expressive styling influenced by Mazda's 'Nagare' design language, with distinctive flowing character lines along the sides and a more prominent front fascia. While maintaining the same basic proportions and sliding door configuration of its predecessor, the updated design gave it a more dynamic appearance. In North America, it received a new 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 157 horsepower, paired with either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The manual transmission was eventually discontinued in 2014. In other markets, various smaller displacement engines and diesel options were available. The interior maintained the 2+2+2 seating configuration with second-row captain's chairs and a two-person third row, continuing the flexible seating arrangements and clever storage solutions of the previous generation. Refinements included improved sound insulation, higher quality materials, and updated technology features. Available equipment included automatic climate control, heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, and a moonroof depending on trim level. Safety features expanded to include standard stability control, anti-lock brakes, and six airbags. The second-generation Mazda5 maintained its unique position in the North American market as a compact minivan focused on efficiency and driving dynamics, though it faced increasing competition from growing crossover SUV offerings. Production for the North American market ended after the 2015 model year, though it continued in other global markets for several more years before being discontinued without a direct replacement as consumer preferences shifted toward SUVs."
